Summer Semester 22 | Learning Lab "Digital Technologies" |

# Assignment 01: Introduction Students

## Objectives
- You will get a first impression about design thinking and Gitlab
- You will know the task of our project

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Mobile Device
- Mural (https://www.mural.co/)
- POP-App Marvel (https://marvelapp.com/pop)

## Solutions Steps

In this Learning Lab, you will learn **Design Thinking**, applicable as an agile method for user-optimized and user-friendly development of innovative products or services, apps, analyses, software and project developments.

In the context of this Learning Lab, you are part of the **Design Thinking Team of your Student Council**.

Since you find the current app of the university to be inappropriate, your task is to **design a favorite app for students**. The new app should address the most important needs of students. The development of your app will be funded by your city.


### Step 1
Boot up your PC/notebook and have your mobile device ready.

### Step 2
Download Git or GitHub to your PC and then fully download the files from the provided Git archive in order to be able to fully execute the Design Thinking module.

### Step 3
Visit the homepage of MURAL (https://www.mural.co/) and create a free account per team (group of 2) and confirm your account with the sent email in your email inbox.

### Step 4
Download Marvel's POP App (Prototyping on Paper App) to your mobile device using the provided QR code of the instructor or the following link (https://marvelapp.com/pop).
Depending on your operating system, select Android (Get it on Google Play) or Apple (Download on the App Store). You will need this app to design your prototype in Phase 5 - Prototype.

### Step 5
After you are fully equipped with the software you will need, begin to learn the theory of each phase of Design Thinking with the materials provided (**Überblick_Design_Thinking.PDF**). 
**Pay attention to the scheduled times of the given timetable (see "timetable.md") as well as the time duration displayed on the classroom screen by the instructor!**



**Structure of the Learning Lab**

Design Thinking is a systematic, human-centered approach to **solving complex problems** within all aspects of life. The approach goes far beyond traditional concerns such as shape and layout. Design Thinkers step into the shoes of the end-user to create solutions and ideas in form of prototypes as early as possible. So potential users can test the solutions in form of prototypes and give early feedbacks before any launch or completion. Also, Design Thinking creates practicle solutions.
A Design Thinking Team consists of multidisciplinary team members. In this case the Design Thinking team consists of 2 team members (students) to design a favorite app for students. In some process steps **one of both team members have to step into the shoes of the end-user**, and the **second team member still has the role of the developer** - and than switch their roles. 
Design Thinking based on agile working, so you have time steps for every phase of the design thinking process.

## Hints

If you have any questions, you can always call the intructor in the room (but he will not act as a couch of design thinking).
