# Assignment 01: Introduction

## Objectives
- You will get a first impression about design thinking and Gitlab
- You will know the task of our project

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Mobile Device
- Mural (https://www.mural.co/)
- POP-App Marvel (https://marvelapp.com/pop)

## Solutions Steps

In this Learning Lab, you will learn **Design Thinking**, applicable as an agile method for user-optimized and user-friendly development of innovative products or services, apps, analyses, software and project developments.

In the context of this Learning Lab, you are part of the **Design Thinking Team of your Student Council**.

Since you find the current app of the university to be inappropriate, your task is to design a favorite app for students. The new app should address the most important needs of students. The development of your app will be funded by your city.


### Step 1
Boot up your PC and have your mobile device ready.

### Step 2
Download Git or GitHub to your PC and then fully download the files from the provided Git archive in order to be able to fully execute the Design Thinking module.

### Step 3
Visit the homepage of MURAL (https://www.mural.co/) and create a free account per team (group of 2) and confirm your account with the sent email in your email inbox.

### Step 4
Download Marvel's POP App (Prototyping on Paper App) to your mobile device using the provided QR code of the instructor or the following link (https://marvelapp.com/pop).
Depending on your operating system, select Android (Get it on Google Play) or Apple (Download on the App Store). You will need this app to design your prototype in Phase 5 - Prototype.

### Step 5
*(Planned Time: 30 minutes)* - After you are fully equipped with the software you will need, begin to learn the theory of each phase of Design Thinking with the materials provided. 
**Pay attention to the scheduled times of the given timetable (see "timetable.md") as well as the time duration displayed on the classroom screen by the instructor!**


**2. Structure of the Learning Lab**

_Scrum, on the other hand, is a framework designed to generate **adaptive solutions to complex problems**. Scrum is based on the [values and principles of agile working](<https://agilemanifesto.org/>) and relies on so-called sprints, i.e. a repetitive process. Scrum provides the following framework: Roles, Events and Artifacts.
A Scrum Team consists of a **Product Owner** (PO), the person responsible for the product, a **Scrum Master**, the methodical coach for PO and developers and the **developers** who are responsible for the planning and product implementation. Interesting: **developers are not only programmer but a mixture of all necessary skills**. Within a Sprint, the Scrum Team goes through the various Scrum Events such as, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Planning, the Backlog Refinement, the Review and the Retrospective. The Scrum artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog and the Product Increment serve as tools._
