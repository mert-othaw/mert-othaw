# Assignment 01: Introduction Students

## Objectives
- You will get a first impression about Design Thinking and Gitlab
- You will know the task of our project

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Mobile Device
- Mural (<https://www.mural.co/>)
- POP-App Marvel (<https://marvelapp.com/pop>)
- Git (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)

## Solutions Steps

In this Learning Lab you will learn **Design Thinking**, applicable as an agile method for user-optimized and user-friendly development of innovative products or services, apps, analyses, software and project developments.

In the context of this Learning Lab you are part of the **Design Thinking Team of your Student Council**.

If you find the current app of the university to be inappropriate, your task could be to **design a favorite app for students**. The new app should address the most important needs of students. 


### Step 1
Boot up your PC/notebook and have your mobile device ready.

### Step 2
Download Git or GitHub to your PC and then fully download the files from the provided Git archive in order to be able to fully execute the Design Thinking module.

### Step 3
Visit the homepage of Mural (https://www.mural.co/) and create a free account per team (group of 2) and confirm your account with the sent email in your email inbox.

### Step 4
Download Marvel's POP App (Prototyping on Paper App) to your mobile device using the provided QR code of the instructor or the following link (https://marvelapp.com/pop) and create an account.
Depending on your operating system, select Android (Get it on Google Play) or Apple (Download on the App Store). You will need this app to design your prototype in "Phase 5 - Prototype".

### Step 5
After you are fully equipped with the aquired softwares, watch the following video shown by the instructor (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZWMj_H8Iqw>). 

**Pay attention to the time box displayed on the classroom screen by the instructor!**



**Structure of the Learning Lab**

Design Thinking is a systematic, human-centered approach to **solving complex problems** within all aspects of life. The approach goes far beyond traditional concerns such as shape and layout. Design Thinkers step into the shoes of the end-user to create solutions and ideas in form of prototypes as early as possible. So potential users can test the solutions in form of prototypes and give early feedbacks before any launch or completion. Also, Design Thinking creates practicle solutions.
A Design Thinking Team consists of multidisciplinary team members. In this case the Design Thinking team consists of 2 team members (students) to design a favorite app for students. In some process steps **one of both team members has to step into the shoes of the end-user**, and the **second team member still stays in the role of the developer** - and than they switch roles. 
Design Thinking is based on agile working, therefore you have time steps for every phase of the Design Thinking process.
