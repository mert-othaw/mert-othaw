## Solutions Steps

After Phase 5 is passed, we can continue with the next Phase, which is called **Test**. This is the final phase of design thinking.


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 6 - test is standing for in design thinking!**

In the final phase "Testing", the prototypes developed by the DT team are tested together on the users. 
With the direct feedback of the user, it is possible to find the best possible solutions for the user. 
Since all phases in the Design Thinking process are iteratively connected, it is possible to refer back to previous phases or, if necessary, to go through all phases again with new knowledge gained from the testing process and user feedback. 
Therefore, sometimes feedback is required to implement efficient optimizations and adjustments. 
Once the "test phase" has been completed, the DT process is also considered complete. 


>In this phase, in our design thinking team of 2 students, the students take turns in their roles as a "developer" and "user" and note their feedback in **1 Template.**



**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for testing in phase 6**

In **"Phase 6 - Test"** (final phase), the Feedback grid technique on the selected Mural template **"Feedback grid"** on the homepage of Mural is useful for documenting the respective feedback on the prototypes by a interview of the user and subsequently making possible adjustments of the prototypes.


For documenting the feedback, students take turns in their roles as a "developer" and "user".

* **Student 1** with the role as **developer** interviews **Student 2** with the role as an **user**. 
* While **Student 1** is interviewing **Student 2**, he should document the respective feedback of **Student 2** as a user on the "Feedback grid" Template of Mural.
* After that, the two roles are swapped (max. timebox 20 min).
* **Student 2** assumes the role as **developer** and interviews **Student 1** with the role as an **user**. 
* While **Student 2** is interviewing **Student 1**, he should document the respective feedback of **Student 1** as a user on the **same** "Feedback grid" Template of Mural.



Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 6 - test:

* Feedback grid
* Qualitative validation
* Qualitative verification
* User Tests



Team members can work with different methods to **test** their prototype with the user. It depends on the prototype which method is the most suitable.
By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" for testing we will use the mentioned Feedback grid technique with the selected **"Feedbackgrid" Template of Mural**: <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448> **on the homepage of Mural** <https://www.mural.co/>.

Fill in the template independently and, if necessary, use the provided example template ("Feedbackgrid.pdf") as a guide. Afterwards, the template should be saved as a pdf. file on the PC to record the results. (As an additional info or help if needed, you could have a look at some tips for the interviews or questionings in the provided file "Interviewing.pdf ".).
