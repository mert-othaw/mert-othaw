## Timebox

45 min

## Solutions Steps

After phase 5 is passed the next phase follows which is called **test**. This is the final phase of Design Thinking.


> Be cautious of the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what "phase 6 - test" stands for in Design Thinking!**

In the final phase "testing", the prototypes developed by the DT team are tested together on the users. 
With the direct feedback of the user, it is possible to find the most suitable solutions for the user. 
Since all phases in the Design Thinking process are iteratively connected, it is possible to refer back to previous phases or, if necessary, to go through all phases again with new knowledge gained from the testing process and the user feedback. 
Therefore, sometimes the feedback is required to implement efficient optimizations and adjustments. 
Once the "test phase" has been completed, the DT process is also considered complete. 


>In this phase, in our Design Thinking teams of 2 students, the students take turns in their roles as a "developer" and "user" and note their feedback in **1 template.**



**2.**  **Working with useful Design Thinking tools for testing in phase 6**

In **"Phase 6 - Test"** (final phase), the Feedback grid technique on the selected Mural template **"Feedback grid"** on the homepage of Mural is useful for documenting the respective feedback on the prototypes with an interview of the user and subsequently making possible adjustments of the prototypes.


>**For documenting the feedback, students take turns in their roles as a "developer" and "user".**
>* **Student 1** in the role as a **developer** interviews the **Student 2** with the role as an **user**. 
>* While **Student 1** is interviewing **Student 2**, he should document the respective feedback of **Student 2** as an user on the "Feedback grid" template of Mural.
>* After that, the two roles are to be swapped (max. timebox 20 min).
>* **Student 2** assumes the role as a **developer** and interviews the **Student 1** with the role as an **user**. 
>* While **Student 2** is interviewing **Student 1**, he should document the respective feedback of **Student 1** as an user on the **same** "Feedback grid" template of Mural.



Useful tools/methods for Design Thinking "phase 6 - test":

* Feedback grid
* Qualitative validation
* Qualitative verification
* User tests



Team members can work with different methods to **test** their prototype together with the user. Which method is the most suitable one depends on the prototype. 
In our Design Challenge "Create a favorite app for students" we will use the mentioned Feedback grid technique for testing, with the selected **"Feedbackgrid" template of Mural**: <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448> **on the homepage of Mural** - <https://www.mural.co/>.

Fill in the template independently and, if necessary, use the provided example template (**"Feedbackgrid.PDF"**) as a guide. Afterwards, the template should be saved as a pdf. file on the PC to record the results. (As an additional info or help if needed, you can have a look at these tips for the interviews or questionings in the provided file **"Interviewing.PDF"**.).



**3.** **Working with Mural template**

* Click "Sign in" on the homepage of Mural <https://www.mural.co/> and log in into your created Mural account and afterwards choose the Mural template named "Feedback grid". You can find this template on this link <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448>.

* In the field "Search" you can type in "Feedback grid" if you can't find the Mural template on the provided link. Double tap on the "Feedback grid" to open this template.

![Search](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/01_Test_Search.PNG) 

* Select "Create mural from this template" and then in the following Pop-Up choose "Create mural".

![Create](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/02_Create_Mural.PNG)

**Before you start to fill in the created mural template, here are some useful hints.**

1. Name your template

![Name](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/04_Name_your_template.PNG)

2. There are different widgets (Text, Shapes and connectors, Icons, Frameworks, Images, Content library, Files, Draw) on the left toolbar that can be used to fill in templates or visualize and document the respective "user" feedback.

3. A timer can be set in the mural, while working on the created mural template.

![Timer](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/06_Timer.PNG)

4. Double click on the left mouse key if you want to write or type something into the "Feedback grid" template.


**Start to work and fill in this template**. 

* As you can see, the feedback grid is divided into 4 fields. 
For each one of these 4 fields, there are also additional 3 questions noted in the template to properly classify the user's feedback into the fields.
>* On the top left you can place the positive feedback.
>* On the top right you can place the negative feedback.
>* At the bottom left you can note new ideas, for example ones that have been developed as a result of the user's feedback.
>* In the field on the bottom right you can place unanswered questions.

![Fillin](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/03_Fill_in_Feedback_01.PNG)

* At first **Student 1 (Developer) interviews the Student 2 (User) and afterwards the developer documents the respective feedback** regarding the created prototype "The favorite app for students" from the previous phase. Double click on the left mouse key to write into the feedback grid template.

>* After Student 1 (Developer) is finished with interviewing and documenting the feedback of Student 2 (User), **the two roles are to be swapped.**

* Then **Student 2 (Developer) interviews Student 1 (User) and afterwards developer documents the respective feedback** as well into the **same** feedback grid template.

**When you're finished don't forget to save the mural template.**

* Click on the icon shown in the following picture to save and download your template.

![Save](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/07_Save_01.PNG)

* Choose the format "PDF" and choose "All content" to download the entire created mural template as a PDF.File on your notebook/pc.

![Download](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/07_Save_02.PNG)

* You also have the option to share your created mural template by clicking on the "Share" button and then copying the link of the POP-UP window.

![Share](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/08_Share_and_Copy.PNG)

**If everything is saved, you can finish your work in this template by going back to the dashboard with the button shown in the following picture.**

## Further Inputs

## Hints

Every phase of Design Thinking is important to create useful solutions! Don't forget to switch roles as "developer" and "user" after 20 minutes to stay in the available timebox of 45 minutes for this phase.
