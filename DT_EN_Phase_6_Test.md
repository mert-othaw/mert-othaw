## Solutions Steps

After Phase 5 is passed, we can continue with the next Phase, which is called **Test**. This is the last phase of design thinking.


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 6 - test is standing for in design thinking!**

In the final phase "Testing", the prototypes developed by the DT team are tested together on the users. 
With the direct feedback of the user, it is possible to find the best possible solutions for the user. 
Since all phases in the Design Thinking process are iteratively connected, it is possible to refer back to previous phases or, if necessary, to go through all phases again with new knowledge gained from the testing process and user feedback. 
Therefore, sometimes feedback is required to implement efficient optimizations and adjustments. 
Once the "test phase" has been completed, the DT process is also considered complete. 





>For "Phase 5 - Prototype " use together in a team of 2 for prototyping your mobile device with Marvel's POP APP (Prototyping on Paper app) to design and save your prototype in this app. (You can use a designed example as a guide, but let your creativity run wild.)


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for testing in phase 6**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 6 - test:

* Feedback grid
* Qualitative validation
* Qualitative verification
* User Tests



Team members can work with different methods to test their prototype with the user. It depends on the prototype which method is the most suitable.
By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" for prototyping we will use the **Feedbackgrid Template of Mural to test** on the homepage of Mural.


>Sometimes there are some errors when designing the favorite app on the mobile device, if that is the case, please use the homepage of Marvel <https://marvelapp.com> to design the favorite app. You will notice whether the error occurs when you have created several pages on the mobile device. 
You can sync your app on the mobile device with your account on the homepage. 
So, for example, you can view and show the app you created on the homepage on your app on the mobile device.



**3.** **Prototype with the Marvel App (POP)**


**How to make a quick App using the Prototyping App of Marvel (homepage)?**

**Check this link before you start to create your favorite students app:** **<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1439vIj-yDk> !**


* Sign in into your created Marvel account and use the widgets as shown in the previous video.

* Log in to your Marvel account and use the tools from the previous video to design your favorite app.

* Remember that this is a design you want to present to the client and highlight your favorite ideas from "Phase 4 - Ideate" in the app.
So it should not be too complex in structure and present the favored ideas.

## Retrospective
Please answer the following questions: 

1. What is the reason of the design thinking phase "test” and how does it work?
2. Which methods you can use in this phase?
