# Assignment 07: Design Thinking Phase 6 - Test

## Objectives
- You learn how Design Thinking is used
- You learn what design thinking phase 6 - test means

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Paper and Pen
- Mobile device with POP APP <https://marvelapp.com/pop>
- Homepage of Marvel App (POP) <https://marvelapp.com>
- Homepage of Mural <https://www.mural.co/> with Feedbackgrid Template <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448>

## Solutions Steps

After Phase 5 is passed, we can continue with the next Phase, which is called **Test**. This is the final phase of design thinking.


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 6 - test is standing for in design thinking!**

In the final phase "Testing", the prototypes developed by the DT team are tested together on the users. 
With the direct feedback of the user, it is possible to find the best possible solutions for the user. 
Since all phases in the Design Thinking process are iteratively connected, it is possible to refer back to previous phases or, if necessary, to go through all phases again with new knowledge gained from the testing process and user feedback. 
Therefore, sometimes feedback is required to implement efficient optimizations and adjustments. 
Once the "test phase" has been completed, the DT process is also considered complete. 





>For "Phase 6 - Test " use together in a team of 2 for testing your mobile device with Marvel's POP APP (Prototyping on Paper app) to design and save your prototype in this app. (You can use a designed example as a guide, but let your creativity run wild.)


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for testing in phase 6**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 6 - test:

* Feedback grid
* Qualitative validation
* Qualitative verification
* User Tests



Team members can work with different methods to test their prototype with the user. It depends on the prototype which method is the most suitable.
By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" for prototyping we will use the Feedback grid technique with the selected **Feedbackgrid Template of Mural to test** <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448> on the homepage of Mural <https://www.mural.co/>.

## Assignment Review

## Retrospective
Please answer the following questions: 

1. What is the reason of the design thinking phase "test” and how does it work?
2. Which methods you can use in this phase?
