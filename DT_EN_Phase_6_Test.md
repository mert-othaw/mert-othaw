## Timebox

45 min

## Solutions Steps

After Phase 5 is passed, we can continue with the next Phase, which is called **Test**. This is the final phase of design thinking.


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 6 - test is standing for in design thinking!**

In the final phase "Testing", the prototypes developed by the DT team are tested together on the users. 
With the direct feedback of the user, it is possible to find the best possible solutions for the user. 
Since all phases in the Design Thinking process are iteratively connected, it is possible to refer back to previous phases or, if necessary, to go through all phases again with new knowledge gained from the testing process and user feedback. 
Therefore, sometimes feedback is required to implement efficient optimizations and adjustments. 
Once the "test phase" has been completed, the DT process is also considered complete. 


>In this phase, in our design thinking team of 2 students, the students take turns in their roles as a "developer" and "user" and note their feedback in **1 Template.**



**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for testing in phase 6**

In **"Phase 6 - Test"** (final phase), the Feedback grid technique on the selected Mural template **"Feedback grid"** on the homepage of Mural is useful for documenting the respective feedback on the prototypes by a interview of the user and subsequently making possible adjustments of the prototypes.


>**For documenting the feedback, students take turns in their roles as a "developer" and "user".**
>* **Student 1** with the role as **developer** interviews **Student 2** with the role as an **user**. 
>* While **Student 1** is interviewing **Student 2**, he should document the respective feedback of **Student 2** as a user on the "Feedback grid" Template of Mural.
>* After that, the two roles are swapped (max. timebox 20 min).
>* **Student 2** assumes the role as **developer** and interviews **Student 1** with the role as an **user**. 
>* While **Student 2** is interviewing **Student 1**, he should document the respective feedback of **Student 1** as a user on the **same** "Feedback grid" Template of Mural.



Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 6 - test:

* Feedback grid
* Qualitative validation
* Qualitative verification
* User Tests



Team members can work with different methods to **test** their prototype with the user. It depends on the prototype which method is the most suitable.
By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" for testing we will use the mentioned Feedback grid technique with the selected **"Feedbackgrid" Template of Mural**: <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448> **on the homepage of Mural** - <https://www.mural.co/>.

Fill in the template independently and, if necessary, use the provided example template ("Feedbackgrid.pdf") as a guide. Afterwards, the template should be saved as a pdf. file on the PC to record the results. (As an additional info or help if needed, you could have a look at some tips for the interviews or questionings in the provided file "Interviewing.pdf ".).



**3.** **Working with Mural Template**

* Click "Sign in" on the homepage of Mural <https://www.mural.co/> and log in into your created Mural account and than choose your Mural Template named "Feedback grid". You can find this template on this link <https://app.mural.co/t/designthinking3783/m/designthinking3783/1660144893937/893a9db441a6b03c7ec4f344c7e7cebb57d01b8c?sender=u321e8a21ffefe6df47a15448>.

* In the field "Search" you can type in "Feedback grid" if you can't find the Mural Template on the link. Double tap on the "Feedback grid" to open this template.

![Search](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/01_Test_Search.PNG) 

* Choose "Create mural from this template" and in the following Pop-Up choose "Create mural".

![Create](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/02_Create_Mural.PNG)

**Before you start to fill the created mural template, here are some hints you can use.**

1. Name your template

![Name](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/04_Name_your_template.PNG)

2. There are different widgets (Text, Shapes and connectors, Icons, Frameworks, Images, Content library, Files, Draw) on the left toolbar you can use to fill your template or visualize and document your respective "user" feedback.

![Widgets](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/05_Widgets.PNG)

3. You can also set a timer in your mural, while working in your created mural template.

![Timer](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/06_Timer.PNG)

4. Double click on the left mouse key if you want to write or type something into the Feedback grid template.


**Start to work and fill this template**. 

* As you can see, the feedback grid is divided into 4 fields. 
For each of these 4 fields, there are also an additional 3 questions noted in the template to properly classify the user feedback into the fields.
>* On the top left you can see the positive feedback.
>* On the top right you can see the negative feedback.
>* At the bottom left to note are ideas, for example new ideas that have developed as a result of user feedback.
>* In the field on the bottom right are unanswered questions.

![Fillin](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/03_Fill_in_Feedback_01.PNG)

* At first **Student 1 (Developer) interviews Student 2 (User) and documents the respective feedback** to the created prototype "Favorite app for students" from the previous phase 5 - prototype on this template. Double click on the left mouse key to write it down into the feedback grid template.

>* After Student 1 (Developer) is finished with interviewing and documenting the feedback of Student 2 (User), **the two roles are swapped.**

* Then **Student 2 (Developer) interviews Student 1 (User) and documents the respective feedback** too on the **same** feedback grid template.

**If you're finished don't forget to save your mural template.**

* Click on the icon shown in the following picture to save and download your template.

![Save](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/07_Save_01.PNG)

* Choose Format "PDF" and choose "All content" to download the entire created mural template as a PDF.File on your notebook/pc.

![Download](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/07_Save_02.PNG)

* You also have to option to share your created mural template if you click on the "Share" Button and copy the link of the POP-UP window if you want to share your created mural template as shown in the following picuture.

![Share](/Phase_6_Test_Screenshots/08_Share_and_Copy.PNG)

**If everything is saved, finish working in this template with going back to dashboard with the following button shown in the following picture.**

## Further Inputs

## Hints

Every phase of design thinking is important to create useful solutions! Don't forget switching roles as "developer" and "user" after 20 minutes to stay in our timebox of 45 minutes for this phase.
