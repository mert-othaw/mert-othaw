# Assignment 03: Design Thinking Phase 2 - Observe

## Objectives
- You learn how Design Thinking is used
- You learn what Design Thinking "phase 2 - observe" means

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Paper and Pen

## Timebox

30 min

## Solutions Steps

After phase 1 has passed the second phase follows which is called **Observe**. 


> Be cautious of the running timer shown by your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check what "phase 2 - observe" is standing for in Design Thinking!**

The second phase, "Observe", is mainly about observing the users involved. The aim is for you as team members to gain expert knowledge for the Design Challenge. For this purpose existing solutions are first analyzed and critically scrutinized. Afterwards, typical users in relevant situations are predefined, observed and additionally **interviewed** personally. 
This refines the common expertise for the task to be solved, as well as observing and analyzing occurring problems and behaviors of the users. 

>In our Design Thinking team of 2 students, 1 student switches into the role of the developer (interviewer) and the second student switches into the role as an user.


**2.**  **Working with useful Design Thinking tools for observing in phase 2**

Useful tools/methods for Design Thinking "phase 2 - observe":

* Qualitative interviews
* Observation and reflection of the interviews taken
* Empathy map


Team members can work with this methods to gain common expertise and empathize into the end-users. In this Design Challenge "Create a favorite app for students" the "qualitative interviews" method is the only one necessary because you as students don't need to gain extra empathy for your own target group (as students).
