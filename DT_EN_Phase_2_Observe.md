**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 2 - observe is standing for in design thinking!**

The second phase, "Observe", is mainly about observing the users involved. The aim is for you as team members is to gain expert knowledge for the design challenge. For this purpose, existing solutions are first analyzed and critically scrutinized. Afterwards, typical users in relevant situations are predefined, observed and additionally **interviewed** personally. 
This refines the common expertise for the task to be solved, as well as observing and analyzing occurring problems and behaviors of the users. 

>In our design thinking team of 2 Students, 1 student switch in the role as a developer (interviewer), and the second student switch in the role as a user.


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for observing in phase 2**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 2 - observe:
