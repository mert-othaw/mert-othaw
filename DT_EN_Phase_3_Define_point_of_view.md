# Assignment 04: Design Thinking Phase 3 - Define point of view

## Objectives
- You learn how Design Thinking is used
- You learn what design thinking phase 3 - define point of view means

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Paper and Pen

## Timebox

2 x 30 min

## Solutions Steps

After Phase 1 and Phase 2 is passed, we can continue with the third phase, which is called **Define point of view**. 


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 3 - define point of view is standing for in design thinking!**

In the "Define point of view" phase, the insights gained by the entire team in the previous observation phase are summarized. With the mutually gained basis, user profiles of the typical users are created and fully described. For these fictitious persons, it is important to separate relevant data and facts for the problem to be solved from less relevant ones and then prioritize them according to importance.



>In our design thinking team of 2 Students, at first student 1 can define his point of view (30 minutes) and than student 2 can define his point of view (30 minutes) and look if they have the same point of view, because they need to define together as a team one point of view. It's very important to have only 1 point of view per group also every team member has the same basis for the following phases.

**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for defining the point of view in phase 3**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 3 - define point of view:

* Storytelling
* Persona
* Nugget Framing
* Reframing
* Jobs to be done
* Point of view
* „How might we…“ question
* User Journey Map – User Stories


Team members can work with this methods to get the same basis and prefer the most important facts to be solved in the following phases 4-6. By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" i would prefer the "How might we.. question" method because in this case you as students for example don't need a persona for students.

## Hints

Every phase of design thinking is important to create useful solutions!
