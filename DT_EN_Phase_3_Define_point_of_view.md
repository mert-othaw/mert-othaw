# Assignment 04: Design Thinking Phase 3 - Define point of view

## Objectives
- You learn how Design Thinking is used
- You learn what design thinking phase 3 - define point of view means

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Paper and Pen

## Timebox

2 x 30 min

## Solutions Steps

After Phase 1 and Phase 2 is passed, we can continue with the third phase, which is called **Define point of view**. 


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 3 - define point of view is standing for in design thinking!**

The second phase, "Observe", is mainly about observing the users involved. The aim is for you as team members is to gain expert knowledge for the design challenge. For this purpose, existing solutions are first analyzed and critically scrutinized. Afterwards, typical users in relevant situations are predefined, observed and additionally **interviewed** personally. 
This refines the common expertise for the task to be solved, as well as observing and analyzing occurring problems and behaviors of the users. 

In the "Define point of view" phase, the insights gained by the entire team in the previous observation phase are summarized. With the mutually gained basis, user profiles of the typical users are created and fully described. For these fictitious persons, it is important to separate relevant data and facts for the problem to be solved from less relevant ones and then prioritize them according to importance.



>In our design thinking team of 2 Students, at first student 1 can define his point of view (30 minutes) and than student 2 can define his point of view (30 minutes). 

**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for defining the point of view in phase 3**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 3 - define point of view:

* Storytelling
* Persona
* Nugget Framing
* Reframing
* Jobs to be done
* Point of view
* „How might we…“ question
* User Journey Map – User Stories



Team members can work with this methods to get common expertise and empathize in end-users. By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" i would prefer the "qualitative interviews" method because you as students don't need a empathy map for students.
