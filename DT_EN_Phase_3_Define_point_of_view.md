# Assignment 04: Design Thinking Phase 3 - Define point of view

## Objectives
- You learn how Design Thinking is used
- You learn what Design Thinking "phase 3 - define point of view" means

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Paper and Pen

## Timebox

60 min

## Solutions Steps

After Phase 1 and Phase 2 are passed the third phase follows which is called **Define point of view**. 

> Be cautious of the running timer shown by your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what "phase 3 - define point of view" is stands for in Design Thinking!**

In the "Define point of view" phase the insights, gained by the entire team in the previous observation phase, are summarized. With the mutually gained basis, user profiles of the typical users are created and fully described. For these fictitious persons, it is important to separate relevant data and facts for the problem to be solved from less relevant ones and then prioritize them according to importance.



>In our Design Thinking team of 2 students, the student 1 should define his point of view (timebox of 20 minutes) first and then the student 2 should define his point of view (timebox of 20 minutes) second. Finally the students must balance their arguments and come to a combination of their views (timebox of 10 min). The result must contain an agreed and joint defined point of view. It's very important to have only one point of view per group so that every team member has the same basis for the following phases.

**2.**  **Working with useful Design Thinking tools for defining the point of view in phase 3**

Useful tools/methods for Design Thinking "phase 3 - define point of view":

* Storytelling
* Persona
* Nugget Framing
* Reframing
* Jobs to be done
* Point of view
* „How might we…“ question
* User Journey Map – User Stories


Team members can work with this methods to get the same basis and to prefer the most important problems to be solved in the following phases 4-6. By the Design Challenge "Create a favorite app for students" the "How might we.. question" method is the simplest in this case, because you as students don't need to create a persona for students. If the team defined their point of view, with the "How might we.." question method the preparation for the following "phase 4 - ideate" started. Write down your "how might we.." questions on a paper and answer them with the focus on the Design Challenge creating a favorite app for students or a better app than the existing students apps.

Every phase of Design Thinking is important to create useful solutions!
