## Perform the following steps one after the other

### Step 1
Boot up your PC.

### Step 2
Visit the homepage of Classroomscreen: https://classroomscreen.com/.

### Step 3
On the homepage, you can select the "Launch now" option (without registration) and get started right away or select the "Or sign up for free" option (with registration). 

Recommendation to the screen setup for a successful implementation of the hybrid design thinking module are to use the following "widgets": 
- Time
- Timer that expires with the scheduled time for a regulated flow of the design thinking module (see "schedule.md")
- stopwatch 
- text
- QR codes for download for Git software, GitHub or GitHub link to PC.
- QR code for download POP app (app for prototyping) to mobile device.
- QR code with link to homepage for MURAL (with or without recommended templates).
- Survey (e.g. current status of teams).

Select the **widgets** you need: (*Info: In the settings there is the possibility to select different languages for the widgets, such as "German" for a German-language element selection of the widgets).
- **Poll widget** for possible polls (current status etc.).
- **QR-Code-Widget** for download of the needed software for PC and mobile device, as well as the link to the homepage of MURAL (https://mural.co/) or e.g. for reference sources or videos for a better understanding of the Design Thinking phases and techniques.
- **Text widget** for specifying instructions, history, etc.
- **Timer widget** for keeping the schedule and the respective techniques of the different phases of Design Thinking.
- **Clock widget** for displaying the current time.
- **Stopwatch widget** for stopping the time e.g. for the final presentation of the results at the end of the workshop.

*If you encounter any difficulties in implementation, you can refer to the sample screenshots for setting up the classroom screen.* (**Screenshot_Launch_now-ohne_Registrierung.png, Screenshot_Beispiel_Classroomscreen-1.png, Screenshot_benötigte_Widgets_Beispiel_Classroomscreen-2.png, Screenshot_QR-Codes für MURAL + Download der POP APP auf Mobilgerät.png, Umfrageoption_in_Classroom_Beispiel.png**).

### Step 4
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* **Welcome students** with announcement of the Design Challenge: "Design a favorite app for students or for you as a student" and forming the groups (teams of 2). 

### Step 5
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* Play/Share video or PowerPoint to provide **Overview and basic understanding of Design Thinking** (Design Challenge + 6 Phases of Design Thinking). 

### Step 6
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* **Phase 1 - Understand:** Share classroom screen and set up **Timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "schedule.md") on screen and let it run to help students keep track of time.

### Step 7
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* **Phase 2 - Observe:** **Run timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 8
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* **Phase 3 - Define point of view 1:** **Run timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "Schedule.md") again on the classroom screen.

### Step 9
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* **Phase 3 - Define point of view 2: Run timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on the classroom screen.

### Step 10
*(Duration: 30 minutes)* - **Announce lunch break**.

### Step 11
*(Planned time: 60 minutes)* **Phase 4 - Ideate:** using brainstorming technique; have MURAL template (www.mural.co) labeled **"Brainstorm & idea prioritization "** (see example: "Ideen generieren und priorisieren.pdf") on hand and **start poll with poll widget in Classroomscreen** to check if students have **"Brainstorm & idea prioritization" template from Mural** available. **Run timer widget of 60 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 12
*(Planned Time: 60 minutes)* **Phase 5 - Prototype:** Students will design and save their prototype on their mobile device using Marvel's POP APP. **Start survey using Poll widget in Classroomscreen** to check if the app works for students, if not the prototype should be displayed on a piece of paper. **Run timer widget of 60 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 13
*(Duration: 15 minutes)* - **Announce coffee break**.

### Step 14
*(Planned time: 45 minutes)* **Phase 6 - Test:** **using the feedbackgrid;** MURAL template (www.mural.co) labeled **"Feedbackgrid "** (see example: **"Feedbackgrid.pdf "**) on hand and **start survey with poll widget in classroomscreen,** to check if students have the **"Feedbackgrid" template from Mural** available. **Run timer widget of 45 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 15
*(Planned time: 90 minutes)* **Presentation of the results (or the designed prototypes) by the student groups** in 3-5 minutes per group (team of 2). **Start stopwatch widget** per group on classroom screen to keep within maximum available 5 minutes - optionally **run timer widget of 5 minutes** again on classroom screen instead of **stopwatch widget**.

### Step 16
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* scheduled time buffer (if needed), otherwise **Farewell students and end module** for example with a final **poll in classroomscreen using Poll widget** whether or not students were able to acquire new digital technology skills (Yes/No) - or whether or not students had fun (Yes/No).
