# Assignment 06: Design Thinking Phase 5 - Prototype

## Objectives
- You learn how Design Thinking is used
- You learn what design thinking phase 5 - prototype means

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Paper and Pen
- Mobile device with POP APP <https://marvelapp.com/pop>

## Timebox

60 min

## Solutions Steps

After Phase 4 is passed, we can continue with the next Phase, which is called **Prototype**. 


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 5 - prototype is standing for in design thinking!**

In the fifth phase of the DT process, the selected ideas or solutions are to be visualized or made understandable for the user. 
This is done by developing a so-called prototype. In this way, ideas take shape and can be better optimized and adapted to the user. 
It is important that the visualization form fits to the product type, whereby the prototypes must be neither complex nor perfected. 
This makes it possible to get initial feedback from the users. This prototype is continuously adapted and improved as the process progresses. 



>For "Phase 5 - Prototype " use together in a team of 2 for prototyping your mobile device with Marvel's POP APP (Prototyping on Paper app) to design and save your prototype in this app. (You can use a designed example as a guide, but let your creativity run wild.)


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for prototyping in phase 5**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 5 - prototype:

* Sketch
* Prototyping - build a prototype from paper, plasticine or various materials
* Mock-up
* Chart
* Role play
* Storytelling
* Storyboards
* Photo/video
* MVP – minimum viable product
* Service blueprint




Team members can work with different methods to visualize their the most important ideas or solution by prototyping. It depends on the prototype which method is the most suitable.
By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" for prototyping we will use the POP (Prototyping on Paper) App of Marvel to prototype on your mobile device.
