## Solutions Steps

After Phase 4 is passed, we can continue with the next Phase, which is called **Prototype**. 


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 5 - prototype is standing for in design thinking!**

In the fifth phase of the DT process, the selected ideas or solutions are to be visualized or made understandable for the user. 
This is done by developing a so-called prototype. In this way, ideas take shape and can be better optimized and adapted to the user. 
It is important that the visualization form fits to the product type, whereby the prototypes must be neither complex nor perfected. 
This makes it possible to get initial feedback from the users. This prototype is continuously adapted and improved as the process progresses. 



>For "Phase 5 - Prototype " use together in a team of 2 for prototyping your mobile device with Marvel's POP APP (Prototyping on Paper app) to design and save your prototype in this app. (You can use a designed example as a guide, but let your creativity run wild.)


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for prototyping in phase 5**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 5 - prototype:

* Sketch
* Prototyping - build a prototype from paper, plasticine or various materials
* Mock-up
* Chart
* Role play
* Storytelling
* Storyboards
* Photo/video
* MVP – minimum viable product
* Service blueprint



Team members can work with different methods to visualize their the most important ideas or solution by prototyping. It depends on the prototype which method is the most suitable.
By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" for prototyping we will use the **POP (Prototyping on Paper) App of Marvel to prototype** on your **mobile device or on the homepage of Marvel.**

On my **APPLE mobile device** there are some errors so I would recommend to use to website of Marvel <https://marvelapp.com/> to prototype!!

>Sometimes there are some errors when designing the favorite app on the mobile device, if that is the case, please use the homepage of Marvel <https://marvelapp.com> to design the favorite app. You will notice whether the error occurs when you have created several pages on the mobile device. 
You can sync your app on the mobile device with your account on the homepage. 
Therefore, you can view and present the app you created on the homepage, also your mobile device.



**3.** **Prototype with the Marvel App (POP)**


**How to make a quick App using the Prototyping App of Marvel (homepage)?**

**Check this link before you start to create your favorite students app:** **<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1439vIj-yDk> !**


* Sign in into your created Marvel account and use the widgets as shown in the previous video.

* Log in to your Marvel account and use the tools from the previous video to design your favorite app.

* Remember that this is a design you want to present to the client and highlight your favorite ideas from "Phase 4 - Ideate" in the app.

> So it should not be too complex in structure and present the favored ideas.


* For example my favored ideas where "the meal of the day in the canteen", "Navigation to lecture rooms", "Examination Office", and a "Quiz Game for Students".

* If you press "play", you can show how it will look on the media you chose, i chose "Iphone" as i created my project on the Marvel homepage.

![Press](/Phase_5_Prototype_Screenshots/02_Press_Play.PNG)

* So this is the first page of my prototype created on the homepage of marvel, and how it looks on the Iphone.

> As an example you can find my full created prototype on the following link: <https://marvelapp.com/prototype/ie25j54>

* If you like to share your created prototype click on the "Share" button.

* On the opening Pop Up click on "Copy" to copy the link of your prototype.

Once you have synced your Marvel account with your mobile device, you can demo your created prototype (student app) on the homepage as well as on your mobile device.
