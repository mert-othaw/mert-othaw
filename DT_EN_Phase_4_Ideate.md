## Solutions Steps

After Phase 1 - 3 is passed, we can continue with the fourth phase, which is called **Ideate**. In this Phase 4 we come over to create solution for our defined problem in the previous phases.

So we go over from understanding the problem and start to solve the problem.After the problem or the design challenge that needs to be solved is understood, it is about **solving the problem**. 
This is done in phases 4 - 6 of design thinking: **"Phase 4 - Ideate, Phase 5 - Prototype, Phase 6 - Test. "**.
We will start with **phase 4 - ideate**.


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 4 - ideate is standing for in design thinking!**

From this phase, the search for solutions for the previously identified problems begins. It is important to generate as many ideas and solutions as possible in the shortest possible time. 
This takes place in the form of various brainstorming techniques, which are particularly well suited for this purpose. Here, all creative ideas and solution approaches are accepted and collected. 
After the extensive collection of ideas, they are evaluated and prioritized.



>In our design thinking team of 2 Students the ideas are generated and prioritized and noted together in 1 Template.


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for ideate in phase 4**


In **"Phase 4 - Ideate "**, ideas are generated, prioritized and noted **together in a team of 2** using the brainstorming technique, on the selected **Mural template "Brainstorm & idea prioritization": <https://app.mural.co/template/94238f11-00b5-42c7-8374-b3dd7c7c0b76/ae150568-42bf-46cc-b205-2f4ba1bdb4ca> on the Homepage of Mural - <https://www.mural.co/>**. 

Fill in the template independently, using the provided **Example Template ("Ideen generieren und priorisieren.pdf")** as a guide if necessary.
The template should then be saved as a pdf. file on the PC.


Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 4 - ideate:

* Brainstorming (different brainstorming techniques)
* How-Now-Wow matrix
* 6-3-5 method
* Moodboard
* 5 Whys method



Team members can work with this methods to ideate for possible solutions. By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" i would prefer the "brainstorming" method to create ideas, note and prioritize it in the selected Mural Template. Also "brainstorming" is one of the most established method for generating ideas.

**3.**  **Working with Mural-Template**

* Click "Sign in" on the homepage of Mural <https://www.mural.co/> and log in into your created Mural account and than choose your Mural Template named "Brainstorm & idea prioritization". You can find this template on this link <https://app.mural.co/template/94238f11-00b5-42c7-8374-b3dd7c7c0b76/ae150568-42bf-46cc-b205-2f4ba1bdb4ca>.

* In the field "Search" you can type in "Brainstorm & idea prioritization" if you can't find the Mural Template on the link.
