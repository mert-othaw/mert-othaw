## Solutions Steps

After Phase 1 - 3 is passed, we can continue with the fourth phase, which is called **Ideate**. In this Phase we come over to create solution for our defined problem in the previous phases.
So we go from understanding the problem and start to solve the problem.


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 4 - ideate is standing for in design thinking!**

From this phase, the search for solutions for the previously identified problems begins. It is important to generate as many ideas and solutions as possible in the shortest possible time. 
This takes place in the form of various brainstorming techniques, which are particularly well suited for this purpose. Here, all creative ideas and solution approaches are accepted and collected. 
After the extensive collection of ideas, they are evaluated and prioritized.



>In our design thinking team of 2 Students, 1 student switch in the role as a developer (interviewer), and the second student switch in the role as a user.


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for ideate in phase 4**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 4 - ideate:

* Brainstorming (different brainstorming techniques)
* How-Now-Wow matrix
* 6-3-5 method
* Moodboard
* 5 Whys method



Team members can work with this methods to get common expertise and empathize in end-users. By our design challenge "Create a favorite app for students" i would prefer the "qualitative interviews" method because you as students don't need a empathy map for students.

Every phase of design thinking is important to create useful solutions!
