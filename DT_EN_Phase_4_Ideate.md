## Solutions Steps

After phase 1 - 3 have passed the fourth phase follows which is called **ideate**. In this "phase 4 - ideate" we pass over to create solution for our defined problem in the previous "phase 3".

So we devolve from understanding the problem (Phase 1 - 3) to start solving the problem. This is done in phases 4 - 6 of Design Thinking: **"phase 4 - ideate, phase 5 - prototype, phase 6 - test. "**.
Let's get started with "**phase 4 - ideate**".


> Be cautious of the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what "phase 4 - ideate" is standing for in Design Thinking!**

From this phase on, the search for solutions for the previously identified problems begins. It is important to generate as many ideas and solutions as you can in the shortest possible time. 
This will be performed in form of various brainstorming techniques, which are particularly well suited for this purpose. Here, all creative ideas and solution approaches are accepted and collected. 
After the extensive collection of ideas, these ideas should be evaluated and prioritized.


>In our Design Thinking team of 2 Students the ideas are generated, prioritized and then noted together in 1 Mural Template.


**2.**  **Working with useful Design Thinking tools for ideate in phase 4**


In **"phase 4 - ideate"** ideas are generated, prioritized and noted **together in a team of 2** using a brainstorming technique with the **Mural template "Brainstorm & idea prioritization": <https://app.mural.co/template/94238f11-00b5-42c7-8374-b3dd7c7c0b76/ae150568-42bf-46cc-b205-2f4ba1bdb4ca> on the homepage of Mural - <https://www.mural.co/>**. 

Fill in the template independently using the provided **Example Template ("Ideen generieren und priorisieren.pdf")** as a guide if necessary.
The template should then be saved as a PDF.file on the notebook.


Useful tools/methods for Design Thinking "phase 4 - ideate":

* Brainstorming (different brainstorming techniques)
* How-Now-Wow matrix
* 6-3-5 method
* Moodboard
* 5 Whys method



Team members can work with this methods to ideate for possible solutions. By our Design Challenge "create a favorite app for students" the "brainstorming" method is the most suitable one to create ideas, note and prioritize the ideas in the selected Mural Template. Furthermore "brainstorming" is one of the most established method for generating ideas.

**3.**  **Working with the Mural-Template**

* Click "Sign in" on the homepage of Mural <https://www.mural.co/> and log in into your created Mural account and then choose the Mural Template named "Brainstorm & idea prioritization". You can find this template under this link <https://app.mural.co/template/94238f11-00b5-42c7-8374-b3dd7c7c0b76/ae150568-42bf-46cc-b205-2f4ba1bdb4ca>.

* If you can't find the Mural template on this link type in "Brainstorm & idea prioritization" in the field "Search".

![Search](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/01_Ideate_Search.PNG) 

* Double tap on the "Brainstorm & idea prioritization" to open this template.

![Find](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/02_Ideate_Find_Template.PNG)

* Choose "Create mural from this template".

![Create](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/03_Create_mural.PNG)

* In the opening Pop-Up choose "Create mural".

**Before you start to fill in the created mural template, here are some useful hints.**

1. Name your template

![Name](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/06_Name_your_template.PNG)

2. There are different widgets (Text, Shapes and connectors, Icons, Frameworks, Images, Content library, Files, Draw) on the left toolbar that can be used to fill in templates or visualize the ideas.

3. Also a timer can be set easily in your created mural during editing.

![Timer](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/07_Timer_in_Template.PNG)

4. On the right side you can also find an outline.

![Outline](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/08_Outline_for_hints.PNG)

5. Double click on the left mouse key to write or type something into the template.

6. In the following picture shows how to zoom in and out with the "-" and "+" button in this template.

**Start to work and fill in this template**. 

* You can write down the defined point of view with the formed "how might we..." questions of the previous Design Thinking "phase 3" if you like **at number 1 of this mural template**. Double click on the left mouse key to write it down.

![Problem](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/05_Define_POV_00.PNG)

* And then switch to **point 2 in this template** to **brainstorm** and write down your generated ideas. Double click on to the orange square to fill it in. 

![Fill](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/05_Double_Tap_to_fill_.PNG)

* In a group of 2 students,the squares can be filled in with the generating ideas by brainstorming in the same mural template. Student 1 fills in his ideas in the squares for person 1. Student 2 fills in his ideas in the squares for person 2.

![Brainstorm](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/05_Brainstorm_ideas_01.PNG)


* In **point 3** in this template the **ideas can be grouped** - so you can cluster similar ideas from non-similar ideas. With **"ctrl-c"** you can copy your previous written ideas in the orange squares from **point 2** and paste it with **"ctrl-v"** to **point 3** in this template.

![Group](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/05_Group_ideas_02.PNG)

* In **point 4** in this template you can **prioritize your ideas** in the given diagram. With **"ctrl-c"** you can copy your previous formed and grouped ideas from **point 3** and paste **"ctrl-v"** them to **point 4** to prioritize them according to importance and feasibility as shown in the diagram.
You can move the squares by **"draging and pulling"** them.

**If you're finished don't forget to save your mural template.**

* Click on the icon shown in the following picture to save and download your template.


![Save](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/09_Save_your_template_01.PNG)

* Choose the format "PDF" and choose "All content" to download the entire created mural template as a PDF.File on your notebook/pc.

![Download](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/09_Save_your_template_02_DL.PNG)

* You also have the option to share your created mural template by clicking on the "Share" button.

![Share](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/11_Share_yor_Template_01.PNG)

* Copy the link if wanted to share the created mural template as shown in the following picuture. 

![Link](/Phase_4_Ideate_Screenshots/11_Share_yor_Template_02.PNG)




**If everything is saved, you can finish your work in this template by going back to the dashboard with the button shown in the following picture.**
