# Assignment 01: Introduction

## Objectives
- You will get a first impression about design thinking and Gitlab
- You will know the task of our project

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Classroomscreen (https://classroomscreen.com/)

## Solutions Steps

In this Learning Lab, you will learn **Design Thinking**, applicable as an agile method for user-optimized and user-friendly development of innovative products or services, apps, analyses, software and project developments.

In the context of this Learning Lab, you are part of the **Design Thinking Team of your Student Council**.

Since you find the current app of the university to be inappropriate, your task is to design a favorite app for students. The new app should address the most important needs of students. The development of your app will be funded by your city.



**1.**   **GoGreen gets started!** 

* For the implementation of the project, a project environment is needed first. We use Gitlab for this purpose. First, each team member needs to log in on the Gitlab Website - here we use the Gitlab of LRZ <https://gitlab.lrz.de>. Enter your HM-email address with "HM-" in front, but without "hm.edu" and your HM-password. Click "Sign in".

  You will then land on the "Projects" landing page. Could be empty or contain a list of your running projects.

  > Choose one participant to continue with the next steps. **Only one team member needs to complete the following steps.**

* Click on the + in the middle on the page header and select "New group". 

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2701_Newgroup.jpg" width="300">

* Create a new group with a click on **"create group"**. Just  ...
  * give your group a group name (like GoGreen, but each group name should be different!)
  * keep the visability level "Private"
  * your role will be software developer
  * we skip the invitation of your team members here
  * click on "create group"

  Welcome to your new group - here, you can start several projects!

* Now, we invite your team members. Click on "Group Information" on the left side, choose "**Members**" ...

* ... and **invite your team members** with their Gitlab accounts and select the role "Developer". After "Invite", the others should have access.

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2701_newmembers.jpg" width="500">

* At the end of our first set up we need to create a new project in our group. Therefore, go to middle of your page and press `+` and **create "new project" in "this group"**. A group can contain several projects.

* Select **"Create blank project"**

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2701_Git_NewProject.jpg" width="500">

* Give you project a nice name like "App" and click on "create project". Now, we have a group to generate several projects and one first project called "App".

With the help of **the agile project management method Scrum** and the **browser-based software Gitlab**, the implementation of the project is to be organized. 

Gitlab offers the possibility to organize project management, task management and agile working on one platform and ensures high transparency for all team members.

**2. Structure of the Learning Lab**

_Scrum, on the other hand, is a framework designed to generate **adaptive solutions to complex problems**. Scrum is based on the [values and principles of agile working](<https://agilemanifesto.org/>) and relies on so-called sprints, i.e. a repetitive process. Scrum provides the following framework: Roles, Events and Artifacts.
A Scrum Team consists of a **Product Owner** (PO), the person responsible for the product, a **Scrum Master**, the methodical coach for PO and developers and the **developers** who are responsible for the planning and product implementation. Interesting: **developers are not only programmer but a mixture of all necessary skills**. Within a Sprint, the Scrum Team goes through the various Scrum Events such as, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Planning, the Backlog Refinement, the Review and the Retrospective. The Scrum artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog and the Product Increment serve as tools._
