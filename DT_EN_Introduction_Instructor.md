# Assignment 01: Introduction

## Objectives
- You will get a first impression about design thinking and Gitlab
- You will know the task of our project

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Classroomscreen (https://classroomscreen.com/)

## Solutions Steps


### Step 1
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* **Welcome students** with an announcement of the Design Challenge: "Design a favorite app for students or for you as a student" and forming the groups (teams of 2). 

### Step 5
*(Planned time: 30 minutes)* Play/Share video or PowerPoint to provide **Overview and basic understanding of Design Thinking** (Design Challenge + 6 Phases of Design Thinking). 



**1.**   **GoGreen gets started!** 

* For the implementation of the project, a project environment is needed first. We use Gitlab for this purpose. First, each team member needs to log in on the Gitlab Website - here we use the Gitlab of LRZ <https://gitlab.lrz.de>. Enter your HM-email address with "HM-" in front, but without "hm.edu" and your HM-password. Click "Sign in".


**2. Structure of the Learning Lab**

_Scrum, on the other hand, is a framework designed to generate **adaptive solutions to complex problems**. Scrum is based on the [values and principles of agile working](<https://agilemanifesto.org/>) and relies on so-called sprints, i.e. a repetitive process. Scrum provides the following framework: Roles, Events and Artifacts.
A Scrum Team consists of a **Product Owner** (PO), the person responsible for the product, a **Scrum Master**, the methodical coach for PO and developers and the **developers** who are responsible for the planning and product implementation. Interesting: **developers are not only programmer but a mixture of all necessary skills**. Within a Sprint, the Scrum Team goes through the various Scrum Events such as, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Planning, the Backlog Refinement, the Review and the Retrospective. The Scrum artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog and the Product Increment serve as tools._
