# Assignment 01: Introduction

## Objectives
- You will get a first impression about design thinking and Gitlab
- You will know the task of our project

## Required Equipment
- Notebook
- Internet access
- Classroomscreen (https://classroomscreen.com/)

## Steps to do


### Step 1
**Welcome students** with an announcement of the Design Challenge: "Design a favorite app for students or for you as a student" and forming the groups (teams of 2). 

### Step 2
Play/Share video or PowerPoint to provide **Overview and basic understanding of Design Thinking** (Design Challenge + 6 Phases of Design Thinking). 

### Step 3
**Phase 1 - Understand:** Share classroom screen and set up **Timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "schedule.md") on screen and let it run to help students keep track of time.

### Step 4
**Phase 2 - Observe:** **Run timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 5
**Phase 3 - Define point of view 1:** **Run timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "Schedule.md") again on the classroom screen.

### Step 6
**Phase 3 - Define point of view 2: Run timer widget of 30 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on the classroom screen.

### Step 7
**Announcement of lunch break of 30 minutes**.

### Step 8
**Phase 4 - Ideate:** using brainstorming technique; have MURAL template (www.mural.co) labeled **"Brainstorm & idea prioritization "** (see example: "Ideen generieren und priorisieren.pdf") on hand and **start poll with poll widget in Classroomscreen** to check if students have **"Brainstorm & idea prioritization" template from Mural** available. **Run timer widget of 60 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 9
**Phase 5 - Prototype:** Students will design and save their prototype on their mobile device using Marvel's POP APP. **Start survey using Poll widget in Classroomscreen** to check if the app works for students, if not the prototype should be displayed on a piece of paper. **Run timer widget of 60 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 10
**Announcement of coffee break of 15 minutes**.

### Step 11
**Phase 6 - Test:** **using the feedbackgrid;** MURAL template (www.mural.co) labeled **"Feedbackgrid "** (see example: **"Feedbackgrid.pdf "**) on hand and **start survey with poll widget in classroomscreen,** to check if students have the **"Feedbackgrid" template from Mural** available. **Run timer widget of 45 minutes** (see "schedule.md") again on classroom screen.

### Step 12
**Presentation of the results (or the designed prototypes) by the student groups** in 3-5 minutes per group (team of 2). **Start stopwatch widget** per group on classroom screen to keep within maximum available 5 minutes - optionally **run timer widget of 5 minutes** again on classroom screen instead of **stopwatch widget**.

### Step 13
scheduled time buffer (if needed), otherwise **Give an official farewell to the students and end module** for example with a final **poll in classroomscreen using Poll widget** whether or not students were able to acquire new digital technology skills (Yes/No) - or whether or not students had fun (Yes/No).



## Further Inputs

If you have any questions to the students, you can use the poll-widget on classroomscreen.
