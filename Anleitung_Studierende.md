# **Instruction for students**

**Required hardware per group:**
* 1 PC + monitor
* 1 mobile device

**Required software:**
* Git credentials (PC)
* MURAL https://mural.co (PC)
* POP-APP https://marvelapp.com/pop (mobile device)



## Perform the following steps in sequence, paying attention to your instructor's split classroom screen.

### Step 1
Boot up your PC and have your mobile device ready.

### Step 2
Download Git or GitHub to your PC and then fully download the files from the provided Git archive in order to fully execute the Design Thinking module.

### Step 3
Visit the homepage of MURAL (https://www.mural.co/) and create a free account per team (group of 2) and confirm your account with your provided email in your email inbox.

### Step 4
Download Marvel's POP App (Prototyping on Paper App) to your mobile device using the instructor provided QR code or the following link (https://marvelapp.com/pop).
Depending on your operating system, select Android (Get it on Google Play) or Apple (Download on the App Store). You will need this app to design your prototype in Phase 5 - Prototype.

### Step 5
*(Planned Time: 30 minutes)* - After you are fully equipped with the software you will need, begin to learn the theory of each phase of Design Thinking with the materials provided. 
**Pay attention to the scheduled times of the given timetable (see "timetable.md") as well as the time duration displayed on the classroom screen by the instructor!**

### Step 6
The design challenge is known "Design your or a favorite student app". 
For this reason, you only need to learn the theory for the first two phases **"Phase 1 - Understand "** *(Planned time: 30 minutes)* and **"Phase 2 - Observe "** *(Planned time: 30 minutes)* and then in **"Phase 3 - Define point of view 1 + 2 "** *( Planned time: 30 minutes each)* ** take turns** in the team to define your point of view on the design challenge and write down your defined point of view on a paper (see "Schedule.md").

### Step 7
After the problem or the design challenge to be solved is understood, design thinking is about **solving the problem**. 
This is done in design thinking in phases 4 - 6: **"Phase 4 - Ideate, Phase 5 - Prototype, Phase 6 - Test. "**.

### Step 8
*(Planned time: 60 minutes)* - In **"Phase 4 - Ideate "**, ideas are generated, prioritized and noted **together in a team of 2** using the brainstorming technique, on the selected **MURAL template ("Brainstorm & idea prioritization" - www.mural.co)**. 
Fill in the template independently, using the provided **Example Template ("Ideen generieren und priorisieren.pdf")** as a guide if necessary.
The template should then be saved as a pdf. file on the PC.

### Step 9
*(Planned Time: 60 minutes)* - For **"Phase 5 - Prototype "** use **together in a team of 2** for prototyping **your mobile device with Marvel's POP APP (Prototyping on Paper app)** to design and save your prototype. *(Again, you can use a designed example as a guide, but let your creativity run wild.)*

### Step 10
*(Planned time: 45 minutes)* - In **"Phase 6 - Test" (final phase)**, the Feedbackgrid technique on the selected **MURAL template ("Feedback grid" - www.mural.co)** is useful for documenting the respective feedback on the prototypes by a survey/interview of the user and subsequently making possible adjustments to the prototypes.

**In this phase, the students take turns in their roles:** **. 
* **Student 1** assumes the role of **developer**.
* **Student 2** assumes the role of **user**.
* After that, the two roles are swapped.
* **Student 1** assumes the role of **User**, **Student 2** assumes the role of **Developer**.

Fill in the template independently and, if necessary, use the provided **example template ("Feedbackgrid.pdf")** as a guide.
Afterwards, the template should be saved as a pdf. file on the PC to record the results. 
*(As an additional info or as a help if needed, you could have a look at some tips for the interviews or questioning in the already saved file **"Interviewing.pdf "**.)*.

### Step 11
*(Planned Time: 90 minutes)* - Summarize your results as a team and **Present your results or present your prototype briefly in 3-5 minutes (per team)**.
