## Solutions Steps

After the Design Challenge is known, we can now start with the first phase, which is called **Understand**. 


> Be careful on which level you are working in the next assignments. You could be on the **group level** or on the **project level**. The easiest way to see if **"epics" is present or not** on the left side. Sometimes the system jumps to the project level.  
> **Nevertheless: all following steps should be done on the group level.**


**1.**  **Let’s visualize the status of our project!**

* Click on the left side on "Issues", then choose "Board".

* In the field "Development" choose "Create new board"

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2702_NewBoard.jpg" width="200">

* Give it a title, select (!) the (open and close) list options, and press "create board". You will see two columns open and closed.

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2702_Boardname.jpg" width="200">

* Let's start with three additional columns: `to do`, `in progress` and `in test`. In Gitlab we need labels for naming columns. Therefore, go to "Group information" (on the left) and click on Labels.

* If you click on "New Label" in the middle of the screen, you can create labels for our board. Just type "to do" and click on "create label". Continue with "in progress" and "in test".

  Should look like that:

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2702_ColumnLabel.jpg" width="400">

* Let's go back to our empty issue board. Please click on "Create List" (a column is called list in Gitlab) to add an additional column. Let's choose the Scope Label and value "to do". Finish with "add to board".

  <img src="../9000_Specific_Files/2702_List_todo.jpg" width="200">

* Let's create the columns for **"IN PROGRESS"** and **IN TEST"**!


The individual columns represent the respective processing status during a sprint. Before a requirement can be marked as completed (called **"closed"** in Gitlab), it must pass through all columns once. In the **"TO DO" column**, you will find all tasks that are still needed to finish a requirement. The **"IN PROGRESS"** column contains all tasks that are currently being worked on, and the "closed"/ done column contains all completed tasks and requirements.



**2.**  **Working with the Scrum Board** 



* The Definition of Done (DoD)

The individual tasks and requirements are displayed on the Scrum board with **visual cards**. The cards are pulled from left to right depending on the status of the processing and thus move through the individual columns until the card is considered completed. This system is also known as the pull principle. As soon as the processing of a task has been started, the corresponding card is pulled from the "TO DO" column to the "IN PROGRESS" column. After the task has been completed and all **Definition of Done (DoD)** criteria have been met, the card is moved to the "DONE" column. 



The DoD are **predefined criteria** that have been accepted by the entire team prior to project execution and create a common understanding of the developers when a requirement is considered done. The DoD always refers to the outcome of a sprint and creates consensus and transparency for the word "done". 



For example, the DoD criteria could be defined as follows:

 

-    All functional tests have been successfully executed

-    All code related to the task has been written

-    Acceptance criteria have been met

-    User documentation has been created and is available 

Review and discuss the criteria for the GoGreen group and make adjustments as necessary. Then deposit the DoD criteria in Gitlab. To do this, click on "Wiki" on the left side and "create your first page" with the discussed DoD.

* Time to get ready for the board!

To focus on the individual tasks (instead of getting confused of too many tasks in the board), you can also set so-called Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits, which limit the number of tasks per column.

Finalize the Scrum board by setting a limit for the "IN PROGRESS" column. To do this, use the star sign besides the plus in the specific column to "List settings". On the right side, you can edit the work in progress limit to 3. This should help the team not to work on too many tasks at the same time.

The final Scrum board help the project team with project organization and project management. In addition, the Scrum Board provides the team with constant transparency regarding the current processing status of individual requirements and tasks, as well as an overview of responsibilities.

## Hints

Keep the Scrum board always up to date!

## Assignment Review

## Retrospective
Please answer the following questions: 

1. What is the “pull-principle” and how does it work?
2. When exactly is a task completed?
