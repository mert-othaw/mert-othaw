After the Design Challenge is known, we can now start with the first phase, which is called **Understand**. 


> Be careful on the running timer of your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check, what phase 1 - understand is standing for in design thinking!**

In relation to the Design Challenge, a common understanding should be created within your team. The focus is on the user and the definition of the target group. You as Design thinkers should exchange views on all possible perspectives within the team in order to internalize the problem of common student apps exactly!


**2.**  **Working with useful design thinking tools for understanding in phase 1**

Useful tools/methods for design thinking phase 1 - understand:

* Mindmapping
* Charette
* Semantic Analysis
* Steakholder Map
* User Journey Map

These are useful methods to understand the Design Challenge "Create a favorite app for students". It's not that hard to understand this Design Challenge, but i would prefer to try the mindmapping method in your team. The explanation of the mindmapping method and how to work with this method, you can find at this link <https://www.designthinking-methods.com/en/1Empathie/mindmappingEM.html>.
