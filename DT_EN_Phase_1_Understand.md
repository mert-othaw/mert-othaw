## Solutions Steps

After the Design Challenge is clear, we can now start with the first phase which is called **Understand**. 


> Be cautious of the running timer shown by your instructor. 


**1.**  **Let’s check what "phase 1 - understand" stands for in design thinking!**

In relation to the Design Challenge, a common understanding should be created within your team. The focus is on the user and the definition of the target group. You as a Design Thinker should exchange views on all possible perspectives within the team in order to internalize the problem of common student apps exactly!


**2.**  **Working with useful Design Thinking tools for understanding in phase 1**

Useful tools/methods for Design Thinking "phase 1 - understand":

* Mindmapping
* Charette
* Semantic Analysis
* Steakholder Map
* User Journey Map

These are useful methods to understand the Design Challenge "Create a favorite app for students". Don't worry to much about understanding the Design Challenge "Create a favorite students app" because as students you already have a good overview about the problem. The mindmapping method is the most suitable method for this Design Challenge in your team and therefore recommended. The description and application of the mindmapping method, can be found at this link <https://designthinking-methods.de/en/1Empathie/mindmappingEM.html>.
